I'm a second year graduate student at UC San Diego pursuing a Master's Degree in Computer Science. I have close to two years of hands-on experience in data science, particularly in analyzing high-volume smart city data across various domains, I have a solid foundation in Python, Java, SQL, and frameworks like PySpark, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and SciKit.

I've worked on projects involving traffic modeling, air quality analysis, music recommendation, and more. Now, specializing in AI and Data Science at UC San Deigo, my focus has evolved towards recommender systems, NLP, fairness in AI, and AI's role in healthcare, disaster management, and streaming services.

I am actively seeking full time opportunities starting in June 2024. My interests lie in Machine Learning, MLOps, Data Science, and Data Analytics.
